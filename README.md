This is a personal project for a android app which you can add movies to a firebase firestore and search for movies using the MovieDB API. This app is for us to know which movies and tv shows we own (Physically on DVD).

Adding movies, deleting and editing (title) works.
Searching for movies on the api works.
Adding TV shows is not yet implemented
